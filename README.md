Word Finder
==============
*under construction*
The purpose of this app is to quickly find all words that can be constructed from a particular set of letters.
For example: Given a list of English words and a set of letters (say “yxmijcmknbshdwifzrsmueist”), it will display all the words that can possibly be constructed from any subset (or all) those letters.

The goal is to minimize the time between receiving the letters and displaying the possible words.
